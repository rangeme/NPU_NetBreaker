# NPU_NetBreaker
This is a script automaticly authorize the NPU iMC portal 


This is the basic version. You can edit your account and you password. It will store them in "c:/users/Your computer/.network/config.conf" with basic encrypt.


If you clicked the "connect" button, it will automaticly send your accont to portal url <h5>every five minutes</h5>. So it maybe not effective in NPU lib.


If you clicked the "disconnect" button, it will send a HTTP packet to server.

These function is not enough, I maybe will update it some days later when I'm free. And there will be a Enhanced Version and its source code is not in public just like the Android Enhanced Version .
